About the timer
The following is my timer project inspired by the Athlean-X video regarding the negative effects on people caused by prolonged sitting.

It uses the classic 30-minute timer that will remind the user about necessary exercises to "Undo" their sitting period.
It alters every time between Grab, Bridge, and Squat exercises and alerts the user that the time is up and what he should do.

For more info about the exercises themself  please watch the original video that encouraged this idea:
